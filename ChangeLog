Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Apr 7 19:56:22 2019 -0700

    If you use data_file_url(), you must first call init_progfile_dir().
    
    And if you call init_progfile_dir(), you must call
    init_process_policies() before that.
    
    And even if you *don't* use data_file_url(), you might use it in the
    future, or you might use other calls to get data file paths, so make
    *all* the extcap programs make those calls.
    
    (Yes, this is important on macOS, for example; it may also be important
    on Windows.  On other UN*Xes we may just compile in the data file path,
    but that's not true on *all* our platforms.)

    BGP: Fix handling of MPLS label for RFC7432
    
    RFC7432 defines MPLS label with a fixed size and not as a stack.
    Each label has 3 bytes and we only decode the first 20 bits. The
    remaining four bits are not defined. Therefore we ignore it at the
    moment.

    TLS: fix potential buffer overflow with a malicious SSL 3.0 session
    
    If a TLS 1.2 cipher suite with SHA384 was in use for a SSL 3.0 session,
    then the "dgst" buffer in ssl3_check_mac could be overwritten with 24
    bytes past the end of the buffer. To prevent this issue, restrict the
    cipher suites that can be used with SSL 3.0.
    
    I did not verify this theory with an actual capture since it is hard to
    do so. An attacker would have to (1) create a malicious, non-compliant
    implementation that (2) creates a network trace, and (3) convince the
    user to install the required decryption secrets.

    Remove incorrectly-inserted "return FALSE;".
    
    That made PACKET_DESCRIBE() do nothing, causing warnings from the Clang
    Static Humiliator.

    Fix up the checks in nspm_signature_version().
    
    Move the read out of nspm_signature_version(), to make it a bit clearer
    what file I/O we do in the open process; have nspm_signature_version()
    just look for a signature in a single page.
    
    In the loop in nspm_signature_version(), make sure we have enough of the
    record header to look at the type and length fields in that header
    before looking at them and, when we can look at them, make sure the
    length of the record 1) fits in what remains of the page we're looking
    at and 2) is big enough to be the length of a signature record.

    Windows: Console log handler fixups.
    
    Make sure that we always print log messages on Windows. External programs
    or scripts (including our test suite) might need to see log messages
    independent of our console settings.
    
    Make sure that we always use our log handler and that its stdout /
    stderr routing matches GLib's. Flush our log output, which is something
    that GLib's default handler sometimes doesn't do:

    Fix the test for a NetScaler trace file.
    
    When testing the signature field against a given version's signature:
    
            we require that the signature field's size (size, not C
            null-terminated string length) be at least the size of the
            signature string (otherwise, it can't possibly match);
    
            we check to make sure that the first N bytes of the signature
            field, where N is the size of the version's signature string
            (not including any terminating '\0' in that string), match the
            version's signature string.
    
    I.e., we require that the version's signature string is a prefix of the
    signature string in the file.
    
    This does not require that the signature string in the file be
    null-terminated.
    
    It also doesn't allow the file's signature string to be a substring of
    the version's signature string, as that's *NOT* sufficient to identify
    the file as a NetScaler trace file, especially if we forcibly
    null-terminate the file's signature string and we trucate it to be
    zero-length, as, in that case, it's *always* a prefix of the version's
    signature string, and the file is incorrectly identified as a NetScaler
    trace file.
    
    (While we're at it, we make the nspm_signature_isvXXX() routines return
    true if it *is* and false if it *isn't*, rather than the reverse; having
    a routine with a name containing "is", and not "isnt", return true if it
    *isn't* is confusing.)

    Add macros for the pack_flags field.
    
    Add macros to extract the direction, reception type, and FCS length
    fields of the pack_flags field, and add definitions for different
    directions and reception types.
    
    Add a macro to construct a pack_flags field value from subfields; this
    is for use by non-pcapng file readers (the pack_flags field is just a
    copy of the EPB flags option, so that's not needed for pcapng).
    
    Move some #defines for that field from packet-frame.c to wtap.h, and
    rename them to match the new macros.
    
    Use the macros rather than rolling our own code.
    
    Fix a variable name in text2pcap.c that apparently had the wrong name,

    1) They're both required, for both strftime() and strptime(), by the
    Single UNIX Specification.
    
    2) They're both supported by MSVC's strftime(), at least as of VS 2015.
    
    3) With MSVC, we use our own strptime(), which is based on the GNU libc
    one and which supports both of them.
    
    So we don't have to worry about them not working and either giving a
    bogus value or throwing an exception or anything such as that.

    Put a fake "FCS OK" value into the tree if we don't have FCS information.
    
    That was what was being done before; do it in the main dissector
    routine, as 1) the main dissector routine doesn't call the FCS or TI
    CC24xx dissector if we don't have an FCS or TI CC24xx metadata trailer
    and 2) that means we pull duplicate code out of those dissectors.
    
    Also, those routines are only called if we have the full FCS/metadata
    available, so there's no need for them to check for that.  (Arguably,
    they should be called if the data is present, according to the reported
    length, even if it's not available in the captured data, so we mark the
    frame as having been cut off so the full data isn't available.)

    Don't use the same variable for the configured FCS type and the tap FCS type.
    
    There's the value the user configured, which should neither be used nor
    modified by the 802.15.4 TAP dissector; that dissector should just set
    the FCS length variable.  It should also call the common dissector, as
    most of the other top-level dissectors do.
    
    That lets us have separate types for the "configured FCS type" and "tap
    FCS type" variables; do so.
    
    Speaking of calling the common dissector, the "non-ASK" dissector should
    do so as well.  Make it so.
    
    While we're at it, fail if there's an unknown FCS type in the tap
    header.

    Clean up ITU-T vs. CCITT, fix some comments.
    
    The CCITT was part of the ITU, and was renamed the ITU-T:
    
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T#History
    
    so just say ITU-T.  As for whose idea those particular 16-bit and 32-bit
    CRC generator polynomials originally were, I don't know. 802.15.4 speaks
    of "a 32-bit CRC equivalent to ANSI X3.66-1979", but there ain't no
    32-bit CRC in that standard, and its 16-bit CRC is Yet Another
    x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1 CRC that they claim came from CCITT/ITU-T V.41;
    V.42 has both 16-bit and 32-bit CRCs.
    
    Clean up more comments about the TI CC24xx metadata trailer.
    
    The "non-ASK PHY" name may have made sense when the type was created, as
    all the PHYs other than ASK, at the time, may have had the same
    preamble/SFD/PHR, but that's no longer true.  List, in a comment, the
    ones to which it applies, all of which have 16-bit CRCs.

    DHCPv6: catch the NTP server suboptions being longer than the whole packet
    
    A router here sends the type and length of suboptions of the NTP Server
    option in dhcpv6 replies in little endian. So the NTP Server option
    looks like:
    
            01:00:10:00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:ff:fe:xx:xx:xx
    
    instead of
    
            00:01:00:10:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:ff:fe:xx:xx:xx
    
    . This makes the dissector throw an exception "Malformed Packet" which
    results in the following options not being dissected.
    
    So check the suboption's length before adding the subtree. This improves
    diagnostics ("suboption too long" instead of "Malformed Packet") and
    results in the suboptions after the bogus one being parsed.
